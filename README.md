# Description
This is a web app developed by Clayton County DoIT for Clayton County Community Development.
The purpose of the application is to help citizens and business owners figure what documents and 
costs are associated with all the different permits, licenses, planning requests, and zoning requests the county has. The application consists of a database (port 5432), a node api server (port 3001), and a node-react web page server (port 3000) as well as Docker config files so they can be containerized.
